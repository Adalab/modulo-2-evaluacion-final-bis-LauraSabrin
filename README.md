# Recovery Exercise:

Deadline: February the 1st.

This time we were asked to develop a social app web to add or save friends from an API with random users.(https://randomuser.me/)

You must need a starter Kit like this one --> https://github.com/Adalab/Adalab-web-starter-kit to run this project.You will need, also:
a shell, 
-install node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
-install sass as well (https://sass-lang.com/install/)
-https://learn.microsoft.com/es-es/windows/wsl/install

At first, we should download or ask for ten results from random's users API including name, city, username and a picture from the user.
(the array structure give us more information but we won'n t need for the moment); we save the information inside  variable an array.
We should be able to show the results of our fetch demand by writing all this new elements from Javscript.

If we click on a user card, this object inside the array will add a new property called "isFriend" so we can differentiate both of them a clicked one or not,by changing the card's color.
We will refresh the page to get 10 new differents users and, in case we made click on several targets , if we press the "save button", we will add the current information to the browser Local Storage.
in case we press the "recover button" , if we have saved something before, the web app will bring us our old users kept as "friends".
